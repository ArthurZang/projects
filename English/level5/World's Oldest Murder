If the iceman was important, he may have been the leader of this community.
One leading theory about his death is that he was assasinated.
In ancient times, to take power you often had to kill the leader.
Perphas the iceman is the target of an assassination.
The murderer may have followed the iceman and killed him from behind.
Then to  protected his identity, he pulled out the arrow and covered the body.
He left the copper ax behind so that he couldn't be identified.
According to this theory, the iceman was killed by a member of his own community.
Therefore the murderer was probably someone he knew.

Another theory is that the iceman was killed after a battle with outsiders.
Since the community was located along an important trade route, it may have been attacked.
The iceman may have been a military leader fighting to defend his village.
Perhaps he was in a battle with the attacker on the day that he died.
According to this theory, he was fleeing from the battle and was caught from behind in an isolated area.

However, from an analysis from his stomach, it is unlikely that he was runing from anyone.
There was a half-pound food in this stomach when he died.
Since food only remain in the stomach for about an hour, he must have eaten a large meat shortly before his death.
Someone who is a hurry would never take the time to stop and eat such a large meal.
And if he was killed outsiders, why didn't they take the cooper ax?
So the question remains what happended on that final day of his life.
The truth is that nobody will never know that really happened.

The iceman's murder will remain a mystery forever.
